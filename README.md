# Express Audio Streaming README

This README provides an overview of the code for an Express application that includes audio streaming functionality. It explains how to set up the application, configure audio streaming routes, and run the server.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Getting Started

To set up the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the code files to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

The application uses the Express framework and relies on the following dependencies:

- express: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- fs: Node.js built-in module for working with the file system.
- dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file.

Configure the environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root of the project directory. Add any necessary environment variables to this file.

## Usage

To start the Express server and run the application, use the following command:

```
npm start
```

The server will start running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Routes

The application includes two routes:

### Home Route

- URL: `/`
- Method: GET
- Description: Renders the index.ejs file using the EJS view engine.

### Audio Streaming Route

- URL: `/audio`
- Method: GET
- Description: Streams an audio file to the client. The audio file path is set to `./audio/song.mp3` in this example. Adjust the file path as needed.

When a client makes a GET request to the `/audio` route, the server reads the audio file and streams it back to the client in chunks. The server logs the streaming process by displaying the length of each chunk and logs a completion message when the streaming is finished. The response headers are set to indicate the content type as `audio/mpeg` and accept ranges in bytes.

## Customize

Feel free to customize the application according to your requirements. You can modify the routes, add additional routes, or extend the functionality as needed.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues or errors, ensure that you have followed the setup steps correctly and that all dependencies are installed. Double-check the file paths and configurations to ensure they are correct.
